For extra credit I did:
    - Non Trivial Graphics Addition: I made some small sprite to represent each ship, which shows aliens getting off.
      I also created an icon for the GUI.
    - Non Trivial controls: I made a queue that will show when q is pressed, the queue will also automatically fill ships
      in as other ships leave. When evacuate is pressed, queue will be erased.
